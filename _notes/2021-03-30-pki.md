There are times when you can't be in the same building as your private local network but want to have the same liberties as if you really were there. Several reasons exist why such a scenario would be desirable:
  - Sitting behind a firewall
  - utilizing a local DNS to easily access resources by name
  - encrypting your connection to the outside world (and hiding it from your local service provider)
  - Exposing legacy services without needing to insulate with various layers of protection
