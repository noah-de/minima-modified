There are times when you can't be in the same building as your private local network but want to have the same liberties as if you really were there. Several reasons exist why such a scenario would be desirable:

  - Sitting behind a firewall
  - utilizing a local DNS to easily access resources by name
  - encrypting your connection to the outside world (and hiding it from your local service provider)
  - Exposing legacy services without needing to insulate with various layers of protection

This is not a new problem and there are already a plethora of solutions out there. [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) (by [EdgeSecurity](https://www.edgesecurity.com/)) offers a point to point solution that is quick and easy to set up. Some organizations already have VPN solutions in place and many vendors would be happy to sell you one.

Here are some notes towards a solution to connect people to a private network using open source software. Specifically using something like EasyRSA to set up a PKI (with [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)) which can then be used with [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) and [VyOS](https://vyos.io/). 

## Guiding Principles 
If your goal is to create a secure environment. Security should be a primary concern. Keep private things *private*. According to [Kerckhoff's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle) (and **Shannon's maxim**), we can share everything but the key. So... that key had better be safe. How safe? The degree of separation may vary, but it is generally considered a good idea to not keep the key on the infrastructure that you are protecting.

## Generating Crypto

If you already have an installation of VyOS, you will find that it has EasyRSA included. This is a convenience to admins but we don't want our key to have ever been on VyOS. We can generate our Key Value pairs on another machine using EasyRSA, OpenSSL or LibreSSL. 

For EasyRSA we can grab a copy from the [release page](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/releases)

    wget https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/releases/download/v3.0.8/EasyRSA-3.0.8.tgz
    tar -xvzf EasyRSA-3.0.8.tgz
    cd EasyRSA-3.0.8

Now that we have the scripts locally, we can make our PKI.

    ./easyrsa init-pki

That command will create a scaffold of your PKI:

```
 pki
├── openssl-easyrsa.cnf
├── private
├── reqs
└── safessl-easyrsa.cnf
```
Copy the example _vars_ file and edit it:
 
    cat vars.example > vars
    vim vars

Some things that you might want to edit would include the mode (changing from _cn_only_ to _org_). 

Next, build your certificate authority (CA). 

    ./easyrsa  build-ca

You will be prompted to enter a passphrase. This is very important to have. Remember that the output of this command will be the ca files (_ca.cert_ and _ca.key_). The cert file is the one that gets distributed and the key file is the super important file that must never be shared. In addition to not sharing it, it should also be encrypted (with the password). 

The generated files are:

```
├── pki
│   ├── ca.crt
│   ├── index.txt
│   ├── index.txt.attr
│   ├── private
│   │   ├── ca.key
```
 
> some older references will have you _source_ the vars file at this point. It is no longer needed (as noted at the top of the file). If you execute the file without arguments, you can see the available arguments, and that the vars file is being read.

Next, generate the Diffie-Hellman key:

    ./easyrsa  gen-dh

Consequently, the dh.pem file will be created in the pki folder.

## Generating Server certificates
While you could take the convenient route and use the _nopass_ flag, don't be shortsighted. Why not add an extra layer of security by encrypting the private key with a password?
    
    ./easyrsa gen-req central
    
Once you issue that command, you will be prompted to enter  and verify a passphrase. Then, you will be prompted to enter every value that you defined in the vars file. It is important to note that the values from the vars file are now the defaults, so you can just accept the defaults.

The resulting files are here:
```
├── pki
│   ├── private
│   │   └── central.key
│   ├── reqs
│   │   └── central.req
```

Sign a certificate request of the defined type.

    ./easyrsa sign-req server central


## Move the needed files to VyOS
Using SCP (or whatever utility you wish), put the needed 5 files in place:

```
$ ls /config/auth/openvpn/
-rw------- ca.crt
-rw------- crl.pem
-rw------- dh4096.pem
-rw------- central.crt
-rw------- central.key
```

Then define them in the VyOS config. When declaring your ovpn tunnel, you will reference these files something like this:

```
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 description 'UDP access to the VPN'
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 encryption 'aes256'
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 hash 'sha512'
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 mode 'server'
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 policy
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 protocol 'udp'
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 server push-route '10.0.1.0/24'
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 server subnet '10.0.2.0/24'
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 tls ca-cert-file '/config/auth/ovpn/ca.crt'
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 tls cert-file '/config/auth/ovpn/central.crt'
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 tls dh-file '/config/auth/ovpn/dh4096.pem'
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 tls key-file '/config/auth/ovpn/central.key'
```


## Generating Client certificates

Now comes the best part! As long as you have access to the transferred files (and the super secret _cert.key_), you can generate client certificates from any other machine to grant access to the PKI. Here is how we would grant access to a client identified by the name _user_tom_. Even though we use `nopass` here, we will still need to input the password to decrypt the _ca.key_ file. 

    ./easyrsa build-client-full user_tom nopass

In order for desktop users to import one file (with all the additional options pre-selected), we can combine the 3 files needed into one OVPN file. There are various ways to automate this step. We will leave that as an exercise.
